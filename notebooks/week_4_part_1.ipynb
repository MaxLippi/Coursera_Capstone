    "This section provides a description of the problem and a discussion of the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people move from their home country every year for different reasons, some of them because are starting a new job or a new business, others for a semester of study and other for love.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these people have something in common, they are locking for a place that is comparable to the current home.\n",

    "+ That the new neighborhood meets a list of requirements such as parks, traditional restaurants, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this work is to demonstrate how using some data science techniques it is possible to help real estate agencies to find apartments for rent that meet the needs of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "A family is moving from their hometown in Rome to Paris.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides a description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Data\n",
    "The following data will be used :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Average cost of a rental house in Paris:__ This information is gathered from this webpage 'https://www.seloger.com/prix-de-l-immo/location/ile-de-france/paris.htm'. The dataset consists of the district number and the average monthly cost of a rented apartment in that district.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Average burglary in the borough of Paris:__ This information is gathered from this webpage 'https://www.bfmtv.com/societe/carte-delinquance-a-paris-quels-sont-les-arrondissements-ou-l-on-recense-le-plus-de-delits_AN-201910180103.html'. The dataset is composed of the district number and the number of annual burglaries in that district.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Information about the venues in Paris neighboroods :__ This information is gathered through FourSquare API. The dataset contains Paris neighborhood information. It consists of the district number, the neighborhood name and all the premises that are present within a 750 meter radius from the neighborhood center. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Information about the venues in home town neighborood :__ This information is gathered through FourSquare API. The dataset contains home town neighborhood information. It consists of the district number, the neighborhood name and all the premises that are present within a 750 meter radius from the neighborhood center. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. __The names of all Paris neighboroods :__ This information is gathered from this webpage 'https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/quartier_paris'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the data is in the proper format and it needs to be transformed. \n",
    "The Geocoder Python package (https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/index.html) will be used to receive the latitude and logitude coordinates of all neighborhoods. The neighborhoods and their corresponding latitude and longitude will be used as input for FourSquare to get information about them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the data will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will analyze the distribution of venues in the Paris neighborhoods to find those neighborhoods that best suit the preferences of the family.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll divide the neighborhoods of Paris into clusters to find the ones that are as similar as possible to the neighborhood of the family's hometown. One hot encoding and k-means will be used for this porpouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is to use the average rental cost per square meter and the crime rate to create a ranking of neighborhoods that meet the customer's needs.\n",
